\section*{Problem 2}
If the multiplication optimisation is taken, the overall improvement will be\\ $\displaystyle\frac{60\%}{8}+(20\%+20\%)=47.5\%$\\With this, the speed up will be 2.11 times faster.

\noindent
Likewise for the division optimization, $\displaystyle\frac{20\%}{3}+(60\%+20\%)=86.67\%$.\\
With this, the speed up will be  1.15 times faster.

\noindent
Management's request for a 5-time execution should be below would equate to $\frac{100\%}{5}=20\%$. Management's request cannot be achieved by making a multiplication or division optimization alone

\noindent
With both optimizations, the new runtime would be $\frac{60\%}{8}+\frac{20\%}{3}+20\%=34.17\%$.\\
With this, the overall speed up is $\frac{1}{0.3717}=2.93$. Therefore, the new machine is 2.93 times faster.
