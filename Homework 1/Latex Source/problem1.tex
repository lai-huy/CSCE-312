\section*{Problem 1}
Before the enhancement executing floating-point instructions took half of 20 seconds, or 10 seconds\\
According to Amdahl's law, $\displaystyle E_{tai}=\frac{E_{tabi}}{A}+E_{tu}$ where $E_{tai}$ is the execution time after the improvement, $E_{tabi}$ is the execution time affected before the improvement, $A$ is the amount of improvement, and $E_{tu}$ is the execution time unaffected.\\
Using this equation, we get $\displaystyle E_{tai}=\frac{10}{5}+10=12$.\\
The new execution time will be 12 seconds which is equivalent to running 1.67 times faster
